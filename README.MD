## Project Overview
This encyclopedia provides a small curated collection of the  most essential German words, categorized for efficient learning.

### Tech Stack
* **Three.js:** The 3D Parallax header using WebGL.
* **GSAP:** Handles the physics-based animations when switching categories.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** Manages the dynamic data injection for the vocabulary lists.
* **CSS3:** Custom responsive layout designed for all screen sizes.

### Categorized Learning
The words are divided into five essential pillars:
1. **Verbs** (Actions)
2. **Nouns** (Objects/Concepts)
3. **Adjectives** (Descriptions)
4. **Pronouns** (Pointers)
5. **Prepositions** (Connectors)
